Hoss — before you paste that into Magicbox, I need to tighten it just a hair so it definitively works and doesn’t accidentally cause downstream regressions.

Here is the final, clean, unambiguous, Magicbox-ready version.
Copy/paste this exact block, nothing added, nothing removed:

✅ MAGICBOX PROMPT — FIX OUTBOUND DIRECTION + KILL DUMMY DATA

Your task is to fix the outbound email direction pipeline so HossAgent behaves correctly as a “set it and forget it” autonomous outbound engine.

Implement ALL of the following changes without breaking existing functionality:

⸻

1. Correct outbound email target

HossAgent must send outbound emails TO THE LEAD (prospect), never to the customer.
	•	Use the email in LeadEvent.lead_email
	•	Do NOT fall back to customer.email
	•	Do NOT send outbound-style messages to the customer about themselves

⸻

2. CC the customer on all outbound email
	•	cc = customer.email
	•	This gives visibility and establishes audit trails
	•	Customer is NOT the primary recipient

⸻

3. Set Reply-To to the customer
	•	reply_to = customer.email
	•	Ensures prospects reply directly to the customer, not HossAgent

⸻

4. Remove all BI-style “observation emails” sent to customers
	•	Delete or disable any logic that sends messages like
“Here’s what I noticed about your business…”
	•	This system is NOT a BI alert system; it is strictly outbound→prospect

⸻

5. Ensure outbound email content references the LEAD, not the customer

Outbound messages must be generated with:
	•	The lead as the subject of the context
	•	The signal that triggered the LeadEvent
	•	The customer’s value proposition

Do NOT generate recommendations to the customer.
Focus all email copy toward the prospect.

⸻

6. Ensure LeadEvents ALWAYS include a real prospect identity

Each LeadEvent must contain:
	•	lead_name
	•	lead_email
	•	lead_company
	•	context summary derived from the originating signal
If any of these fields are missing, DO NOT generate outbound.

⸻

7. Do NOT create LeadEvents for signals about the CUSTOMER

If a Signal refers to the customer’s own company name, domain, or profile:
	•	Log it internally
	•	Mark it as IGNORED_SELF_SIGNAL or similar
	•	Do NOT generate a LeadEvent
	•	Do NOT generate outbound
	•	Do NOT notify the customer

⸻

8. Update admin and portal UI

Reflect correct outbound directionality in:
	•	Admin console:
	•	Outbound target (lead)
	•	CC (customer)
	•	Reply-To (customer)
	•	Email preview
	•	Customer portal:
	•	Show pending outbound drafts (if review mode)
	•	Show sent outbound in activity log
	•	NO messages addressed to the customer as prospect

⸻

9. KILL ALL DUMMY SEED DATA

Remove ALL references to:
	•	DummySeed provider
	•	Fake Miami HVAC/Yelp/BBB test signals
	•	Past development LeadEvents, Tasks, or dummy prospect emails
	•	Anything that could cause outbound to point at the customer

Clean the database so the system operates ONLY on real signals and real customer configurations.

⸻

10. After implementing changes, verify the pipeline

Run a controlled dry test:
	1.	Insert one fake LeadEvent with:
	•	a clearly fictional lead (e.g. “testlead@example.com”)
	•	NOT matching the customer’s name or domain
	2.	Trigger outbound in DRY_RUN
	3.	Verify:
	•	Outbound email goes TO the lead
	•	CC includes customer email
	•	Reply-To is customer email
	•	No emails are sent to the customer except CC copies
	•	No “recommendation” emails are generated
	4.	Then run live mode (EMAIL_MODE=SMTP or SENDGRID)
	•	Confirm correct behavior end-to-end

Document all code changes and assumptions inline.

⸻

Do not proceed to any further features until outbound direction and dummy data cleanup are fully corrected and verified.

⸻

✔ Copy that directly into Magicbox.

This is the exact corrective surgery HossAgent needs.

When she finishes?
Outbound finally becomes real, clean, and correct — the way the Hoss intended.
