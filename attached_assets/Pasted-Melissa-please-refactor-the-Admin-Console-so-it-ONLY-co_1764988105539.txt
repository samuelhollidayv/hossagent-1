Melissa — please refactor the Admin Console so it ONLY contains three tabs:

1) Customers
2) Support Inbox
3) Analytics

Absolutely NO views or tables that list individual leads, OSINT failures, unenriched records, mission logs, or per-lead enrichment states. 
If a lead is not usable by a customer, I do not want to see it in the UI at all. 
Failures should only roll up into aggregate metrics on the Analytics tab.

---

### 1. Customers Tab

Purpose: manage accounts and impersonate customers.

Requirements:
- Table of all customers with columns:
  - customer_id
  - Name
  - Email
  - Status (active / trial / cancelled)
  - Signup date
  - Subscription plan and renewal date
- Row actions:
  - “View as customer” (impersonate their portal, read-only is fine)
- Customer detail view:
  - Same fields as table plus:
    - Billing status (from Stripe or local billing)
    - Last login time
    - Primary contact email
    - Per-customer autopilot toggle (on/off) **only as a high-level flag**, not per-lead

No leads table, no enrichment states, no raw signals anywhere in this tab.

---

### 2. Support Inbox Tab

Purpose: respond to customer issues.

Requirements:
- Simple list of support tickets / messages submitted by customers
- Columns:
  - Customer
  - Subject
  - Created at (local time)
  - Status (open / in progress / closed)
- Detail view for a ticket:
  - Full message body
  - Internal notes field
  - Status dropdown
- Optional: link back to the Customer detail page

No outbound email tools here beyond replying to support tickets.
No lead or enrichment controls.

---

### 3. Analytics Tab

Purpose: high-level health dashboard only.

Requirements:
- Aggregate metrics only, such as:
  - Total signals ingested (by day)
  - Total leads created (by day)
  - Enrichment rates (% with domain, % with email)
  - Outbound_sent count
  - Error rates (e.g., rate-limit hits, scraping failures) as rollup numbers
- Visuals:
  - Line chart for “signals → leads → enriched → outbound_sent” over time
  - Simple cards for key KPIs (e.g., current enrichment rate, total active customers)
- NO drill-down tables of individual leads or failures.
- Failures are represented only as counts / percentages, not rows.

All timestamps shown in the admin’s local timezone.

---

### Global Constraints

- Remove any existing tabs or components that:
  - Show unenriched or archived leads
  - Show individual mission logs
  - Allow per-lead enrichment actions or outbound actions
- Admin Console is for:
  - Account management (Customers)
  - Customer support (Support Inbox)
  - System health (Analytics)
- Anything related to **individual leads or outbound messaging** must live only in the customer portal, not in Admin.

Please implement this simplified Admin Console and strip out all legacy lead/enrichment tables from the admin UI.
