Archive the current investor-facing landing page (don’t delete it—just move or hide it so we can access later). Then reframe the current “Control Room” as the Admin Dashboard for internal use (admin-only), and build a Customer Portal for external client access. Here’s what each interface should include:

⸻

1. Admin Dashboard (for me):
	•	Show all leads, customers, tasks, invoices, and agents
	•	Allow override or debugging (e.g., manually edit customer/task data)
	•	Toggle automation on/off per customer or globally
	•	View logs of agent activity
	•	View revenue and profit stats
	•	Add new customers or leads manually if needed

⸻

2. Customer Portal (for them):

Accessible by customer login/email or a secure token-based link.

Show each customer:
	•	Their company name and contact
	•	Their current status and plan
	•	Active + completed tasks (what’s being worked on and what’s done)
	•	Agent summaries / research summaries
	•	Invoices with amount, due dates, and payment status
	•	Stripe billing integration (update card, pay invoices, view history)
	•	Optional: ability to approve or reject new scopes of work (e.g., new research jobs, proposals, etc.)

⸻

3. Automation (Core Logic Refactor):

Remove the need to manually click “Run BizDev” or “Run Invoicing” in the UI.

Instead:
	•	System should autonomously initiate lead gen and business operations on a schedule (e.g. every X hours)
	•	Automatically create tasks when leads are converted
	•	Automatically assign tasks to agents
	•	Automatically invoice customers upon task completion
	•	Automatically update the database and UI to reflect all this activity
	•	Admin should be able to toggle automation on/off (globally or per customer)

Use background tasks / scheduling (e.g., FastAPI background tasks or APScheduler) to run these loops outside the main request cycle.

Make sure agents do not require human initiation to perform their job loops.

If needed, introduce an async event loop or lightweight task queue pattern to manage jobs across agents.
