PROMPT — Fix All Timestamps to Use User’s Local Time (Portal + Admin)

Melissa — normalize timestamps to user local time in both Portal and Admin Console.

Context:
	•	Right now, timestamps in the Customer Portal and Admin Console are confusing / inconsistent.
	•	Some are showing server time / UTC, not the end-user’s local time.
	•	We already store canonical times in UTC in the database.

Goal:
	•	All times displayed in the UI (lead created, last updated, outbound sent, etc.) should be shown in the user’s local time zone, with an explicit label.
	•	Behavior should be consistent across:
	•	Customer Portal
	•	Admin Console
	•	Any drill-down / detail views

Requirements:
	1.	Back-end / data model
	•	Keep storing timestamps in UTC as the source of truth.
	•	Do NOT change how times are stored in the DB.
	2.	User time zone detection
	•	For authenticated users, add a time_zone field on the User (string, e.g. "America/New_York").
	•	On first login, detect time zone in the browser using JS (Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone) and POST it to a small endpoint to save on the user record.
	•	On subsequent requests, server templates can use current_user.time_zone to render localized times.
	3.	Rendering logic
	•	Create a single helper function, e.g. format_local_time(utc_dt, user_time_zone) that:
	•	Converts UTC to user’s tz (using pytz or zoneinfo).
	•	Returns a string like: Dec 5, 2025 · 5:42 PM
	•	Use this helper everywhere we show times in:
	•	Admin leads table (created_at, updated_at, outbound_sent_at, etc.)
	•	Portal opportunities list and detail pages
	•	If for any reason user_time_zone is missing, default to "America/New_York" for now and append " (ET default)" to the timestamp so it’s obvious.
	4.	UI text / clarity
	•	Add a small label at top of Portal and Admin like:
	•	Times shown in: America/New_York (pull from user_time_zone).
	•	If defaulting, show: Times shown in: America/New_York (default)
	5.	Acceptance criteria
	•	Changing my system time zone and refreshing should result in new users getting timestamps in that local zone.
	•	Existing user: after the first time zone detection runs once and saves, all timestamps for that user are consistently shown in their timezone across portal and admin.
	•	No changes to how timestamps are persisted; only display / small user field addition.
	•	If JS is disabled, we still show timestamps in ET with a (default) label rather than silently being wrong.
