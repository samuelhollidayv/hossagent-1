Here it is, brother — the definitive post-build checklist.
This is the list Melissa should run after implementing everything to verify nothing from the architecture, enrichment engine, SignalStorm, or MacroStorm intelligence layer got missed.

This is not a “nice-to-have” list.
This is the we are going to war with this product checklist.

Every checkbox must be green or we don’t ship.

✅ HOSSAGENT — POST-BUILD SYSTEM VALIDATION CHECKLIST

(Melissa’s Complete Engineering Verification Guide)

⸻

SECTION 1 — ENRICHMENT ENGINE (ARCHANGEL v2/v3)

1.0 Lead State Machine

Confirm all these states exist and behave correctly:
	•	UNENRICHED
	•	WITH_DOMAIN_NO_EMAIL
	•	ENRICHED_NO_OUTBOUND
	•	OUTBOUND_SENT
	•	ARCHIVED_UNENRICHABLE

Checks:

☐ enrichment_attempts increments per pass
☐ max_enrichment_attempts enforced
☐ Leads automatically transition to ARCHIVED_UNENRICHABLE when budget exhausted
☐ unenrichable_reason stored

⸻

1.1 Mission Log

Must record every enrichment action.

☐ Log entries include: timestamp, pass number, enrichment phase, query/scrape attempt, result
☐ Log prevents repeating the same search/scrape/query
☐ Mission log is visible in admin console (condensed)

⸻

1.2 NameStorm v2

Multiple name candidates with confidence scores.

☐ Lead contains candidate_company_names array
☐ Names come from:
	•	Title NER
	•	Body NER
	•	Meta tags
	•	Schema.org
	•	Heuristic reconstruction

☐ NameStorm logs chosen candidate per pass
☐ DomainStorm cycles through names in confidence order

⸻

1.3 DomainStorm v2

Layered, stateful, persistent domain discovery.

Confirm each layer works AND logs:

☐ Layer 1: Extract URL from signal metadata
☐ Layer 2: Scrape article for outbound links / schema.org org URLs
☐ Layer 3: Heuristic domain generation (coolrunningair.com, etc.)
☐ Layer 4: DuckDuckGo/Google-like HTML query WITH:
	•	budget limits per pass
	•	exponential backoff
	•	5-minute cooldown after rate limit triggers

☐ Layer 5: PhoneStorm-assisted reverse lookup
☐ DomainStorm skips repeated layers via mission log
☐ Domain found → state advances to WITH_DOMAIN_NO_EMAIL

⸻

1.4 PhoneStorm v2

Phones act as enrichment data and identity pivot.

☐ Extracts phones from:
	•	article HTML
	•	domain homepage
	•	/contact
	•	/about
	•	directory pages

☐ Normalizes to E.164
☐ Classifies type (MOBILE, LANDLINE, VOIP, etc.)
☐ Logs extraction
☐ Stores phones on lead
☐ DomainStorm uses phones for reverse lookup

⸻

1.5 EmailStorm v1

Layered email discovery.

☐ On-site scrape for emails
☐ Generic patterns (info@ / contact@ / sales@ …) tested via SMTP lite
☐ Person-based guesses applied if name available
☐ Search-for-@domain.com OSINT queries
☐ Logs results
☐ First deliverable → ENRICHED_NO_OUTBOUND

⸻

1.6 Unenrichable Logic

☐ Must check for “no progress across passes”
☐ Must assign reason:
	•	NO_DOMAIN_FOUND
	•	NO_CONTACT_INFO_FOUND
	•	NO_WEB_PRESENCE
	•	FAILED_OSINT
☐ Must archive gracefully

⸻

⸻

	•	confidence score

2.2 Lead → Company Matching

☐ Matching by:
	•	normalized name + geo
	•	domain (primary key)
	•	phone (secondary key)

☐ Leads linked via company_id
☐ Enrichment updates Company, not just lead

⸻

2.3 Cached Success + Negative Evidence

☐ If company exists with domain+email → enrichment short-circuits
☐ If company exists with “unenrichable” tag → enrichment short-circuits with reason
☐ Cached phone numbers reused
☐ Cached email patterns reused

☐ Avg enrichment attempts
☐ Unenrichable reasons distribution
☐ Outbound bounce rate
☐ Outbound reply rate (once enough volume)
☐ Lead volume per source

⸻

SECTION 8 — READINESS CHECK

Melissa must answer “YES” to all:

Does the system now attempt enrichment recursively?

Does enrichment stop cleanly with reason codes?

Do leads no longer stall silently?

Does SignalStorm produce real SMB leads?

Does MacroStorm generate strategic leads?

Does ForceCast expand one macro event into many SMB targets?

Does PhoneStorm assist finding the domain/company?

Is deduplication working at the Company level?

Does outbound messaging include real context?

Does the customer portal only show actionable items?

If any answer is NO → we’re not done.
