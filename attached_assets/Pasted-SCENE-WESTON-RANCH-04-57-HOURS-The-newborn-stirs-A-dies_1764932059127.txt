SCENE: WESTON RANCH, 04:57 HOURS
The newborn stirs.
A diesel generator hums in the background.
Lightning flashes over Sawgrass Expressway.
ARCHANGEL flaps its wings in the server logs.
And Hoss stands there like General Patton holding a bottle in one hand and a SaaS empire in the other.

You spoke the words.

Now you get the full, classified, end-to-end, multi-phase Telephony Battle Plan —
the definitive blueprint to integrate phone enrichment, SMS strategy, call flows, UX, compliance, and AI intelligence into HossAgent.

This is not some half-baked plan.

This is THE TELEPHONY DOCTRINE for HossAgent.

Let’s begin.

⸻

⚡⚡⚡ TELEPHONY BATTLE PLAN — OPERATION ARCHANGEL: SIGNAL NOIR

(Full-stack spec: technical + UX + outbound + compliance-ready)

⸻

PHASE 1 — PHONE DISCOVERY & ENRICHMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE)

🎯 Goal

Every domain ARCHANGEL touches must yield phone numbers with confidence scoring and validation.

🔧 Engineering Requirements

1. Phone Extraction During Scrape

Per-page regex extraction to detect:
	•	US local formats
	•	International formats
	•	Embedded schema.org
	•	tel: links
	•	Footer/Contact info blocks

Regex library (multi-pattern):

(\+?\d{1,3})?[\s.-]?\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}

2. Normalization

Convert all extracted numbers to E.164 standard:

+19545550192

Add fields to LeadEvent:

lead_phone_raw: str
lead_phone_e164: str
phone_confidence: float
phone_source: str ("homepage", "footer", "contact_page", "schema", etc.)

3. Phone Confidence Scoring

Scoring logic:

Source	Score
Contact Page	+0.8
Homepage Header	+0.7
Footer Listing	+0.6
About Page	+0.5
Random Page	+0.3
Directory (ignored)	0

4. Phone Value Vector

ARCHANGEL should compute:
	•	phone_is_mobile (carrier lookup / heuristic via prefixes)
	•	phone_is_landline
	•	phone_is_virtual (VoIP detection possible later)
	•	phone_is_corporate (based on number repetition across signals)
	•	phone_is_local (area code match vs Miami/Broward list)

This affects:
	•	Ranking of opportunities
	•	SMS eligibility
	•	Tone of messaging

⸻

PHASE 2 — CUSTOMER PORTAL TELEPHONY UX

🎯 Goal

Make phone data useful, not just visible.

🔧 Portal UX Enhancements

1. Contact Card Upgrade

Add section:

Phone Contact
	•	Click-to-call link (tel:)
	•	Tag (Mobile / Landline / HQ / Low-Value Generic)
	•	Badge showing High Value if mobile or local

2. Recommended Action

Include:

“Consider calling if urgent — outbound SMS available as follow-up.”

3. SMS Template Preview

Within opportunity card:

Suggested SMS:
“Hey {FirstName}, Sam Holliday here in Miami.  
Saw {signal summary}. Wanted to share a local insight that might help — is this a good number?”

4. “Call Script” Section

Human-like talk track:

“Hey there, this is Sam Holliday — I run a Miami-based tool that tracks real local business 
patterns. Something came across my desk today about {event}. Wanted to share a quick idea…”

This makes the portal feel like a sales ops assistant.

⸻

PHASE 3 — USER-TRIGGERED SMS OUTBOUND (OPT-IN ONLY)

(We NEVER auto-send SMS — compliance warhead engaged.)

🎯 Goal

Enable SMS as a manual outbound channel with guardrails.

🔧 Engineering Requirements

1. Twilio (or SignalWire) Integration

New environment variables:

ENABLE_SMS = true
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER

2. SMS API Endpoint

POST /sms/send
payload: { lead_event_id }

3. Logging

Store:
	•	sent_at
	•	message_body
	•	delivery_status
	•	error_codes

4. SMS Throttling
	•	Max 2 SMS/day per customer
	•	Max 1 SMS/week per lead

5. Compliance

Add required opt-out tag:

Reply STOP to opt out.

6. Customer Portal UX

Add button:

[ Send SMS ]
Visible only when:
	•	lead_phone exists
	•	confidence >= threshold
	•	ENABLE_SMS = true

⸻

PHASE 4 — INTELLIGENT SMS STRATEGY ENGINE

(This is where HossAgent gets dangerous.)

🎯 Goal

ARCHANGEL proposes SMS follow-ups strategically based on event type + timing + recipient type.

Example Logic:

A. Competitor Intel

“New competitor entering Miami — SMS follow-up increases conversion likelihood.”

B. Market Entry

“First-mover advantage — SMS can create immediate rapport with local players.”

C. Growth Opportunity

“Air conditioning demand spike — a quick text could secure early bookings.”

D. Market Shift

“Urgent timing — SMS recommended within 24 hours.”

This turns SMS from “annoying” to “surgical.”

⸻

PHASE 5 — FUTURE WEAPONRY (OPTIONAL, POST-LAUNCH)

1. AI-Assisted Phone Calls
	•	User clicks “Call Lead”
	•	HossAgent generates:
	•	call script
	•	rebuttal map
	•	follow-up email
	•	automatic CRM note

2. AI Voice System (Later)
	•	Your ElevenLabs-trained voice
	•	Calling leads with:
	•	compliance preamble
	•	friendly greeting
	•	handoff to human on interest
	•	fallback to voicemail

3. Voicemail Drop (Manual Trigger Only)
	•	“Hey, this is Sam from HossAgent…”
	•	Sends pre-recorded voicemail to ringless mailbox

4. Response Intelligence

Store and evaluate:
	•	call outcomes
	•	SMS replies
	•	classify into:
	•	Not Interested
	•	Interested
	•	Call Back Later
	•	Wrong Number

This eventually turns into an AI sales cycle system.
