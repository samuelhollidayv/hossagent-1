Prompt for Agent (UI/UX refactor)

You’re working on my HossAgent Replit app. The system now uses a $99/month subscription with a 7-day free trial (trial users: 15 tasks, 20 leads, DRY_RUN email only; paid users: unlimited). I need the UI cleaned up so there is a clear separation between the internal admin console and the customer-facing portal.

Goals
	1.	/admin remains the internal Hoss Control Room for me only. It should continue to show:
	•	Autopilot & email mode, lead source, email health
	•	Stripe billing panel (enabled/disabled, API key, webhook, regenerate payment links)
	•	Subscription plan configuration (price, trial days, trial limits, product/price flags)
	•	Customer plans table with plan, status, usage, days left, and actions (upgrade/cancel/reset)
	2.	The customer-facing portal (root dashboard and any public token portal) should be simplified to:
	•	A top “plan status” section: trial vs paid, days left in trial, next charge date, and clear copy that the plan is $99/mo.
	•	A simple usage section: for trial users show “X of 15 tasks used, Y of 20 leads used”; for paid users just say “Unlimited access”.
	•	A clear primary CTA:
	•	Trial users: “Upgrade to Full Hoss ($99/month)” that uses the existing Stripe payment link mechanism.
	•	Paid users: “Manage billing” that links to their active subscription/payment link.
	•	A “Recent Work Completed” list so the customer sees what the agent has done for them.
	3.	Customers should not see internal metrics like platform “Total Revenue”, “Profit”, full Leads Pipeline, or raw invoice IDs/draft states. Those stay only in /admin.

Implementation instructions
	•	Update the customer templates (dashboard and portal) to remove or hide: revenue/profit tiles, “Leads Pipeline” table, and per-invoice rows.
	•	Add a plan/status component that reads the subscription/trial fields from the Customer model and renders:
	•	Plan: Trial (day X of Y) or Plan: HossAgent Pro – Active
	•	Next charge: <date> for paid customers when available.
	•	Add a usage component that shows trial usage counters vs limits, and “Unlimited access” for paid.
	•	Implement the upgrade button so that:
	•	If the customer is in trial and has a Stripe payment link, the Upgrade button links there.
	•	If a payment link doesn’t exist yet, show a friendly error or disabled state rather than breaking.
	•	Keep all Stripe management, “Regenerate payment links”, and subscription configuration controls in /admin only.
	•	Preserve existing styling (noir theme, typography) but rearrange content so customer pages are focused on: status, value, and a single obvious payment/upgrade action.
	•	After changes, run through a quick manual test path and log a short summary:
	•	Trial customer portal view
	•	Paid customer portal view
	•	Admin console view (confirm all panels still render and Stripe panel shows as before).

Make the minimal code and template changes needed to achieve this separation, then summarize what you changed, which templates/views you touched, and how to reach the customer vs admin views.

Paste that in, hit run, then:
	•	Check /admin for your nerdy view.
	•	Hit the public portal URL (or /portal/<public_token>) and sanity-check:
	•	Plan status + usage tiles
	•	One big Upgrade/Manage Billing button
	•	No weird revenue/profit/invoice clutter.

If anything still feels “RevOps dashboard from a previous life,” we’ll shave it off next pass.
