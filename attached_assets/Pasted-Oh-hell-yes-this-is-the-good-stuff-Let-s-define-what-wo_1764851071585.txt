Oh hell yes, this is the good stuff.
Let’s define what “working” actually means for HossAgent end-to-end.

Below is a soup-to-nuts UAT script: you can literally walk this like a checklist every time you ship a big change. Think of it as “Did the Hoss actually do the job?” broken into flows.

I’ll assume:
	•	You’re on the prod Replit URL.
	•	Stripe + SMTP + EMAIL_MODE are already set.
	•	Dummy data has been nuked or clearly marked as test.

Use this however you want, but if you run these flows clean and everything passes, you’re not in fantasyland—you’ve got a functioning system.

⸻

0. Environment & Secrets Sanity Check

Goal: Make sure the pipes are real before we touch UI.

Steps:
	1.	Open Replit Secrets.
	2.	Verify these exist and look sane (no typos, no extra spaces):
	•	EMAIL_MODE = SMTP or SENDGRID (for now you’re on Gmail SMTP)
	•	SMTP mode:
	•	SMTP_HOST (e.g. smtp.gmail.com)
	•	SMTP_PORT (587)
	•	SMTP_USERNAME
	•	SMTP_PASSWORD (app password)
	•	SMTP_FROM_EMAIL (matches your “from” address)
	•	Stripe:
	•	STRIPE_API_KEY (live secret key)
	•	STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
	•	STRIPE_DEFAULT_CURRENCY = usd (or whatever)
	•	ENABLE_STRIPE = TRUE
	•	HossAgent config:
	•	ADMIN_PASSWORD
	•	LEAD_GEOGRAPHY
	•	LEAD_NICHE
	3.	Confirm EMAIL_MODE is not DRY_RUN if you actually want live sends.

Expected:
	•	App boots with no env-related stack traces.
	•	Admin console email indicator shows SMTP (or SENDGRID) and “healthy”.

⸻

1. Landing Page & Signup Flow

Goal: A stranger hits the URL and can understand what HossAgent does and sign up for a trial.

1.1 Landing Page Copy & Layout
	1.	Hit root URL (e.g. https://…spock.replit.dev/).
	2.	Check:
	•	Hero headline matches what MVP does now (contextual leads / opportunities, not “full AI COO” magic).
	•	Subhead explains: HossAgent watches for opportunities & surfaces them to you; outreach runs in autopilot/review mode.
	•	CTA buttons:
	•	Start Free Trial / Start 7-Day Trial → /signup
	•	No “Book a Demo” button (we killed that).
	•	Footer has:
	•	Brand line
	•	Link to Operator Console (/admin) for you.

Expected:
	•	Page feels like a real product, not Heaven’s Gate.
	•	Copy doesn’t oversell beyond current feature set.

1.2 Signup Flow
	1.	Click Start Trial.
	2.	On /signup:
	•	Enter a new test email (e.g. test+uat1@yourdomain.com).
	•	Set password.
	3.	Submit.

Expected:
	•	Signup succeeds.
	•	You land in customer portal (not admin).
	•	Trial banner visible (e.g. 7-day trial, tasks/leads usage = 0).

⸻

2. Customer Portal – Basic Experience

Goal: New customer sees a sane, self-explanatory dashboard.

From fresh signup:
	1.	Confirm top of page shows:
	•	Plan name (Trial / Pro).
	•	Price (e.g. $99/mo).
	•	Trial days remaining.
	•	Tasks used / Leads used counters (0/0 initially).
	•	Start Paid Subscription button.
	2.	Below that, confirm sections:
	•	“Recent Opportunities” or “Lead Events” (even if empty).
	•	“Task History” or “Recent Work”.
	•	“Reports” (if present; may be empty).
	•	“Settings” link / tab.
	3.	Click Settings:
	•	Fill in:
	•	Business Information:
	•	Short description (use the blurb we wrote).
	•	Services (comma separated).
	•	Pricing notes (brief).
	•	Target / Ideal customer (Miami SMBs, etc.).
	•	Excluded customers (e.g. enterprise, certain industries).
	•	Communication Style:
	•	Tone: Confident + Friendly.
	•	Style: Conversational + Data-Driven (pick one primary).
	•	Contact Info:
	•	Name: Hoss
	•	Email: your Gmail you wired to SMTP.
	•	Outreach Mode:
	•	Start with Review (so you can approve).
	•	Autopilot:
	•	Enabled.
	4.	Save settings.

Expected:
	•	Settings persist.
	•	Refresh page – values still there.
	•	Back on dashboard, summary reflects your business identity (blurb, etc.).

⸻

3. Auth: Login, Logout, Forgot Password

Goal: Basic account lifecycle works for a mortal.
	1.	From portal, click Log out.
	2.	Go back to root → click Login:
	•	Use the account you just created.
	•	Verify login works.
	3.	Close browser tab, reopen, hit /portal:
	•	See if session persists (depends on cookie behavior; aim for staying logged in for a while).
	4.	Click Forgot password link on login:
	•	Enter the same email.
	•	In DRY_RUN: reset link should log to console.
	•	In real SMTP: check your inbox for reset email.
	5.	Click reset link:
	•	Set new password.
	•	Confirm you land in portal logged in.

Expected:
	•	Forgot password flow works end-to-end.
	•	Broken / expired token shows friendly error.
	•	No weird 500s.

⸻

4. Admin Console – Operator View

Goal: You can see and control the system from the War Room.
	1.	Visit /admin.
	2.	Login with ADMIN_PASSWORD.
	3.	On main admin screen, check:

	•	Customers table:
	•	Shows the trial account you just created.
	•	Columns: email, plan, trial end, tasks used, leads used, autopilot status.
	•	Buttons per customer:
	•	View as customer.
	•	Upgrade.
	•	Cancel.
	•	Email panel:
	•	Shows EMAIL_MODE.
	•	Shows recent email attempts (if any).
	•	Signals / LeadEvents / Pending outreach tabs:
	•	May be empty initially, but UI loads with no errors.

Expected:
	•	No dummy “seed” customers unless you intentionally left them for testing.
	•	If they exist, mark them clearly or delete them.

⸻

5. Signals & LeadEvents – Opportunity Creation

Goal: Prove the engine can create LeadEvents/opportunities for a customer.

There are two ways: wait for real signals or force a test.

5.1 Trigger / Confirm Signals
	1.	In admin, find the Signals Engine / Run now / “Manual cycle” button (if present).
	•	If not, you may need to wait for cron/autopilot interval (5–15 min).
	2.	After a cycle:
	•	Check Signals tab:
	•	New rows show up with source, type, timestamp, score.
	3.	Check LeadEvents tab:
	•	Some signals should be converted into LeadEvents for your test customer:
	•	Show lead name, company, context summary, status = NEW.

Expected:
	•	Signals exist.
	•	LeadEvents created with non-garbage context (not your own business).

⸻

6. Outbound Engine – Direction & CC Logic

Goal: Outbound emails go to the lead, CC the customer, Reply-To customer. No more “emailing yourself about yourself”.

For this you need at least one LeadEvent with a real test email you control.

6.1 Create a Test Lead

In admin (or via the portal, if supported):
	1.	Create a fake lead manually:
	•	Lead name: “Test Lead UAT”.
	•	Email: use an alternate inbox you own (e.g. yourname+leadtest@gmail.com).
	•	Company: fake or real.
	•	Context: “Testing outbound pipeline.”
	2.	Ensure it shows in LeadEvents with status = NEW.

6.2 Outbound in Review Mode
	1.	In your customer portal settings:
	•	Outreach mode = Review.
	•	Autopilot = Enabled.
	2.	Wait for next BizDev/autopilot run or trigger manually if a button exists.
	3.	In portal:
	•	Look for Pending Outreach / “Emails to approve”.
	4.	Open a pending email.

Expected:
	•	“To” = Test Lead email.
	•	“CC” = your customer email (from settings).
	•	“Reply-To” = your customer email.
	•	Body references the lead’s business context, NOT “Dear [your business name]…”

	5.	Approve one email.
	6.	Check inboxes:
	•	Lead inbox gets the email.
	•	Customer inbox (you) gets CC.
	•	If you hit “Reply” from lead inbox, it should reply to customer email, not some internal address.

Expected:
	•	No emails addressed to the customer as if they’re a prospect.
	•	Lead status updates to CONTACTED (or equivalent).

6.3 Outbound in Auto Mode
	1.	Change outreach mode = Auto – Emails sent automatically.
	2.	Ensure Autopilot ON.
	3.	Let it run.

Expected:
	•	New LeadEvents get emails automatically sent.
	•	Admin Outbound log shows:
	•	To: lead email
	•	CC: customer email
	•	Reply-To: customer email
	•	Mode: SMTP / SENDGRID
	•	Status: success.

⸻

7. Reports / Task History – Value Delivery

Goal: The portal actually shows work product, not just numbers.

7.1 Generate a Report

Ideally there’s a button like “Run Research Snapshot” / “Generate report” in portal or admin.
	1.	Trigger a report for your test customer (e.g. competitive analysis, market snapshot).
	2.	Let Ops agent generate it.
	3.	Check admin/logs to confirm the report was created.

Expected data model:
	•	A Report record with:
	•	customer_id
	•	title
	•	summary
	•	full_content (text / HTML)
	•	created_at

7.2 Portal Surface

Back in customer portal:
	1.	Go to Reports / Recent Work section.
	2.	Confirm:
	•	You see an entry for the new report:
	•	Date
	•	Title
	•	Short description.
	•	Clicking it:
	•	Opens full report (page or modal) with content.
	3.	Check Task History:
	•	Should show a row like:
	•	Type: Research report / Analysis.
	•	Status: Completed.
	•	Date/time.

Expected:
	•	Reports are visible and readable in the portal.
	•	Task/lead counters:
	•	tasks_used incremented.
	•	If report tied to a LeadEvent, leads_used may also increment.

⸻

8. Billing & Stripe – Trial → Paid

Goal: User can go from trial to paid via Stripe or via admin override.

8.1 Trial Banner
	1.	In portal:
	•	Verify trial copy: days remaining, tasks/leads used.
	•	“Start Paid Subscription” button visible.

8.2 Stripe Checkout
	1.	Click Start Paid Subscription (as test flow).
	2.	Ensure:
	•	You’re taken to a Stripe Checkout or Payment Link.
	•	Amount = $99/mo (or whatever your plan is).
	•	Plan name matches product identity.
	3.	DO NOT actually charge your real card unless you want to. This can be a smoke-test step only, or you do it once.

Expected:
	•	After a successful Stripe payment (even if simulated once), subscription status:
	•	Changes to ACTIVE / Pro.
	•	Trial banner disappears.
	•	Portal shows “Your subscription is active.”

Note: If webhooks aren’t fully tested yet, you can rely on admin override.

8.3 Admin Upgrade Override
	1.	In /admin, find your test customer row.
	2.	Click Upgrade.
	3.	Refresh:

Expected:
	•	Subscription now shows ACTIVE / Pro.
	•	Trial countdown gone.
	•	Limits may show “Unlimited” / not enforced.

8.4 Cancel Subscription (MVP)
	1.	In customer portal:
	•	For a paid account, click Cancel subscription.
	2.	Confirm messaging:
	•	“Your subscription will stay active until end of current period…”
	3.	In admin:
	•	See cancelled_at_period_end or similar flag set.

Expected:
	•	No immediate access loss.
	•	Future billing will not recur (once wired to Stripe fully).

⸻

9. Admin Controls: View as Customer, Comp, Kill Dummy Data

Goal: Operator has god-mode but in a safe, understandable way.
	1.	In /admin → Customers:
	•	Use View as Customer:
	•	Confirm it takes you into that customer’s portal context.
	2.	Use Upgrade, Cancel, maybe Comp / free plan if present.
	3.	Confirm:
	•	Changes reflect in portal immediately.
	4.	If legacy/dummy customers exist:
	•	Use delete/cleanup tools to wipe them, or:
	•	Rename them clearly as “TEST – DO NOT USE” and push them off-screen.

Expected:
	•	No orphaned or confusing accounts.
	•	You can always get back to admin easily.

⸻

10. Support & Observability

Goal: You can debug when things go sideways.
	1.	Trigger:
	•	A failed email (e.g. bogus SMTP credentials in a throwaway env).
	•	A failed Stripe config (e.g. invalid API key in DRY env).
	2.	Observe in logs / admin:
	•	Failures are logged with clear messages.
	•	System falls back to DRY_RUN or gracefully errors without crashing autopilot.
	3.	Check:
	•	Email logs show [EMAIL][MODE][FAIL] with reason.
	•	Signals/LeadEvents don’t explode the app if one source breaks.

⸻

11. “Hoss as Customer” Scenarios

Goal: You’re your own first customers.

Run two profiles in prod:
	1.	HossAgent LLC (B2B SMB target, Miami GTM).
	2.	Your YouTube Outlaw Music persona (for future lead gen / bookings).

For each:
	•	Fill settings with the info we wrote (services, who they serve, etc.).
	•	Turn on Autopilot.
	•	Run for a day and watch:
	•	Do you get actual opportunities?
	•	Does the outbound copy match your brand voice?
	•	Are you seeing real value from the reports and opportunities?

This is the truth test. Everything else is just lab work.

⸻

How to Use This Script
	•	Treat each section (0–11) as a test suite.
	•	When you make a big change:
	•	Re-run at least sections 1–4, 6, 7, 8.
	•	Keep a simple spreadsheet:
	•	Columns: Test Case, Status (Pass/Fail), Notes, Date.
	•	When something fails:
	•	Capture the exact symptom.
	•	Feed it back to Magicbox as:
“Here’s the behavior, here’s what should have happened—fix the code so X holds true.”

⸻

If you want, I can turn this into:
	•	A copy-paste checklist (markdown table or Google Sheet template).
	•	A “HossAgent QA Playbook.md” text you can drop in your repo so any future engineer (or agent) can run the same gauntlet.

But if you walk through everything above and it all behaves as expected?

Then yeah, Hoss:
the machine’s not a demo anymore.
It’s a product.
