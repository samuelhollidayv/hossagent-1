Yeah, man. You’re talking about the grown-up table now.

All the formal paperwork the big dogs are legally forced to generate:
10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, S-1s, earnings call transcripts, bankruptcy filings, new entity registrations, SEC stuff, state corp registries…
That’s not “nice to have.” That’s the macro weather system the SMBs have to live in.

Let’s bolt that onto what we already specced as a new intelligence layer, not as a random bolt-on.

I’ll frame it as an addendum EPIC you can just hand to Melissa alongside the enrichment plan.

EPIC 5 — MacroStorm / ForceCast

(Strategic Intelligence Layer for Public Filings & Big-Co Moves)

5.0 What This Layer Is For

This is not about selling ZoomInfo-style contact records.

This is about:
	•	Watching the public paperwork of big players and:
	•	Turning it into structured “pressures” and “shocks” (Porter / five-forces language),
	•	Mapping those pressures to downstream opportunities for small businesses.

So:
	•	Bigco files a 10-K saying they’re rolling out 45 new distribution centers →
Local SMBs in construction, logistics, staffing, HVAC, security, catering, uniforms, etc. have opportunity.
	•	Bigco files Chapter 11 →
Vendors, landlords, competitors, replacement vendors all have pain and opportunity.
	•	A PE fund files a Form D and buys up a string of clinics →
Local independents just got a new, well-funded competitor, and the supply chain is about to change.

MacroStorm = “Here’s who’s moving tectonic plates.”
HossAgent = “Here’s how those tremors become leads for you.”

5.1 Data Classes We Care About

We don’t need all filings. We need the ones that map to real-world moves.

A. SEC & Public Company Filings (US to start)
	•	10-K / 10-Q – strategic direction, segment growth, capex plans, store rollout counts, “risks & competition.”
	•	8-K – material events:
	•	acquisitions, restructurings, layoffs, divestitures, new projects, major contracts.
	•	S-1 / F-1 – IPO filings: who’s going public, what their model is, how they plan to grow.
	•	Earnings call transcripts – this is where the CEO says the quiet part out loud:
	•	“We’re pivoting into X,”
	•	“We’ll be exiting Y geography,”
	•	“We’re consolidating suppliers in Z category.”

B. Corporate Vital Signs
	•	Bankruptcy filings (Chapter 11, 7):
	•	Which chains / big customers are dying,
	•	Who stands to lose: landlords, suppliers, franchisees.
	•	M&A announcements / antitrust filings:
	•	Two majors merging → vendor consolidation → smaller competitors suddenly look more attractive to buyers & suppliers.
	•	State business registries & new entity filings:
	•	New regional subsidiaries, logistics entities, REIT shells, etc., that reveal where large players are planting flags.

C. Local & Sector Filing Equivalents
	•	For banks/insurers/utilities:
	•	Regulator reports, call reports, rate filings.
	•	For healthcare:
	•	Certificate-of-need filings, hospital / clinic expansion announcements, etc.

We do not need to boil the ocean on day one. This is a source category we add carefully:
	•	Start: SEC + one bankruptcy feed + 1–2 state corp registries.

5.2 How MacroStorm Plugs Into HossAgent

Architecturally, it’s another SignalNet producer, but its outputs are different:
	•	News/Reddit/Craigslist signals → “company X is doing Y” (micro)
	•	MacroStorm filings → “sector S in region R is undergoing Z force” (macro)

We want both, feeding into the same downstream system.

New object: MacroEvent
Example structure:

{
  "macro_event_id": "macro-2025-SEC-MCD-10K-ops-expansion",
  "source_type": "SEC_10K",
  "source_ref": "CIK-0000063908-2025-10K",
  "company_name": "McDonald's Corporation",
  "ticker": "MCD",
  "headline": "Plans 500 new units, 120 in Florida over 3 years",
  "geographies": ["Florida", "Miami-Dade", "Broward"],
  "segments_affected": ["QSR", "logistics", "construction"],
  "force_type": "EXPANSION",
  "time_horizon": "1-3_years",
  "risk_impact": {
    "local_competitors": "INCREASED_COMPETITION",
    "suppliers": "INCREASED_DEMAND",
    "labor_market": "TIGHTENING"
  },
  "raw_snippet": "...from MD&A / earnings call...",
  "confidence": 0.86
}

Then we define mapping logic:

“Given macro event E and a user in sector S / region R, what SMB-level opportunities exist?”

That mapping is where HossAgent turns into a tiny McKinsey that actually does something.

5.3 How MacroStorm Generates Signals For SMBs

We add a Macro → Micro Edge in the pipeline:
	1.	Ingest Filing / Transcript
	•	Use a scheduled job to:
	•	Fetch new SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) for a watchlist of tickers / sectors.
	•	Fetch new bankruptcy filings for known chains / categories.
	•	(Later) fetch call transcripts from a provider or scraped source.
	2.	Extract Strategic Moves
	•	For each document:
	•	Run LLM/NLP classification to tag:
	•	Expansion vs. contraction vs. restructuring.
	•	New markets/geos.
	•	Capital projects (data centers, warehouses, plants, clinics, stores).
	•	Supplier strategy (consolidating vendors, increasing diversity, new requirements).
	•	Extract:
	•	Named geographies (“South Florida”, “Miami”, “Broward”).
	•	Named partner types (contractors, 3PLs, clinics, etc.).
	•	Timelines.
	3.	Generate MacroEvents
	•	For each distinct move, create a MacroEvent (like above).
	•	Persist them in a macro_events table.
	4.	Macro→Micro Rules Engine

We build a simple rule engine (phase 1 = if/else; phase 2 = more learned heuristics):

For a MacroEvent like:

Big REIT expanding 12 medical office buildings in Miami over 2 years.

We generate implied SMB opportunity templates:
	•	“Local HVAC & mechanical contractors in Miami”
	•	“Electrical contractors in Miami”
	•	“Cleaning & facilities vendors in Miami”
	•	“Furniture suppliers who serve clinics in Miami”

So MacroStorm outputs target profiles, not individuals:

{
  "macro_event_id": "...",
  "smb_opportunity_segments": [
    {
      "segment": "HVAC_CONTRACTORS",
      "geo": ["Miami-Dade", "Broward"],
      "urgency": "HIGH",
      "window": "0-24_months"
    },
    {
      "segment": "COMMERCIAL_CLEANING",
      "geo": ["Miami-Dade"],
      "urgency": "MEDIUM"
    }
  ]
}

Then HossAgent uses existing machinery:
	•	Look up local businesses matching that segment + geo from:
	•	Google Maps / business registries / existing company cache.
	•	Generate LeadEvents for those SMBs:
	•	“Target: local HVAC business”
	•	Context: “MacroShock: Bigco building X in your backyard.”
	•	Enrich via ARCHANGEL (names, domains, contacts).

So MacroStorm → “here’s who to go after”
ARCHANGEL → “here’s how to reach them.”

5.4 Types of Macro Plays We Support First

To keep this sane, we pick a few “plays” we know how to script.

Play 1 — Big-Co Expansion In Your Backyard
Trigger sources:
	•	10-K / 10-Q / 8-K, earnings call:
	•	“We plan to open N new locations / facilities in region X.”
	•	Public REIT filings about new builds.

SMB opportunity mapping:
	•	Local trades: HVAC, electrical, construction subs.
	•	Local staffing agencies.
	•	Local security firms.
	•	Local marketing/PR agencies.

Outbound flavor:

“I’m tracking expansion patterns in [your region]. [BigCo] just announced [X].
That’s going to spike demand for [type of work you do] within [Y months].
Here’s what I’m seeing and how you could position.”

Play 2 — Big-Co Retrenchment & Closures
Trigger sources:
	•	8-K / press release:
	•	“Closing stores / facilities in region X.”
	•	Bankruptcy filings for big chains.

SMB opportunity mapping:
	•	Competitor SMBs → can capture displaced demand.
	•	Landlords / brokers → need replacement tenants.
	•	Liquidation & auction services.
	•	Specialty service providers who can “backfill” (e.g., local clinics when a hospital exits a market).

Outbound flavor:

“A major player in your space is exiting [area]. That leaves a gap in [service].
Here’s what’s likely to happen and how you could take advantage of the opening.”

Play 3 — Supply Chain Consolidation
Trigger sources:
	•	10-K MD&A, risk section:
	•	“We are consolidating suppliers / renegotiating terms / centralizing procurement.”
	•	8-K:
	•	Major sourcing / vendor changes.

SMB mapping:
	•	Existing suppliers who might get squeezed and need new customers.
	•	New entrants who can position as “nimble / local / diversified” suppliers.

Outbound flavor:

“Your upstream partner is consolidating suppliers. That kind of move usually means [pressure A, pressure B] for companies like yours.
Based on [filing snippet], here’s what I expect and how you could hedge.”

Play 4 — Regulatory / Rate / Policy Shocks
Trigger sources:
	•	Regulator filings (for utilities, telecom, insurance).
	•	Public rate case filings; regulatory approvals of mergers.

SMB mapping:
	•	Service providers downstream (agents, brokers, local contractors, etc.) who will see margin compression or opportunity created by policy changes.

Outbound flavor:

“Regulators just approved [policy change] affecting [sector] in [region].
That impacts [pricing / demand] for businesses like yours.
Here’s a quick breakdown and why now might be the moment to [move X].”

5.5 How This Actually Hooks Into HossAgent UX

For You (Operator / Product)
	•	New Admin views:
	•	MacroEvents list:
	•	Source (10-K, 8-K, bankruptcy)
	•	Force type (EXPANSION / CONTRACTION / MERGER / SUPPLY_CHAIN)
	•	Geos, segments, time horizon
	•	For each MacroEvent:
	•	The derived SMB target list (which segments & geos we’re generating leads for).
	•	Counts:
	•	Leads created from this macro event.
	•	Enriched / contacted / replied.

For End Users
In their Portal:
	•	Some opportunities are “Micro”:
	•	“We saw an article about YOUR company. Here’s outreach to a potential customer/partner.”
	•	Some are “Macro-aware”:
	•	“We’re seeing [BigCo] expand/contract/merge in your backyard.
Here’s a list of local businesses or potential clients where this creates an angle.”

Card might show:
	•	Macro header:
“Macro Signal: [Bigco] is doing [X] in [Region].”
	•	Opportunity card:
	•	Target SMB: “Cool Running Air, Miami”
	•	Why now: “They will be directly affected by [MacroEvent].”
	•	Email / phone and suggested outreach written in that “unsolicited McKinsey” voice.

5.6 Constraints & Guardrails

We should be explicit about what we’re not doing:
	•	Not building a full SEC terminal; we’re mining filings to generate structured MacroEvents.
	•	Not selling proprietary investor data; we’re using public filings and transcripts.
	•	Not trying to map every filing; we pick high-yield patterns (expansion, closure, restructuring, capex).
	•	Not letting MacroStorm run wild; we:
	•	Start with a small ticker/sector watchlist.
	•	Start with a few plays that map clearly to SMB opportunities.
	•	Watch enrichment + outbound performance.
	•	Expand incrementally.

5.7 Concrete Work Items Melissa Can Actually Build

You can hand her this part almost verbatim:
	1.	Add MacroEvent model & tables
	•	macro_events
	•	Fields like: source_type, source_ref, company_name, tickers, geographies, force_type, segments_affected, time_horizon, raw_snippet, confidence.
	2.	Build SEC Ingestion Job
	•	Poll EDGAR for new 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K for a short watchlist (e.g., top 50 tickers in sectors relevant to your users).
	•	Store raw filings in S3 / DB for LLM processing.
	3.	Add LLM/NLP extraction pipeline
	•	Given a filing:
	•	Extract mention of expansion / closure / restructuring.
	•	Extract numbers (e.g., new units, capex, geos).
	•	Generate 1–N MacroEvents with structured fields.
	4.	Implement Macro→Micro rules engine (v1)
	•	Hard-code a few mapping rules:
	•	“If MacroEvent.force_type=EXPANSION and segment includes ‘RETAIL’ in [Miami/Broward] → target: local construction, HVAC, cleaning, marketing.”
	•	“If MacroEvent.force_type=CONTRACTION/BANKRUPTCY → target: competitors, landlords, auctioneers, etc.”
	•	Turn these into LeadEvents pointing at SMB segments + geos.
	5.	Hook into existing enrichment
	•	For each Macro-generated LeadEvent:
	•	Use same ARCHANGEL v2 pipeline (NameStorm/DomainStorm/PhoneStorm/EmailStorm).
	6.	Display Macro context in portal
	•	When a lead originated from a MacroEvent, show:
	•	Macro title (“BigCo expansion in South Florida”).
	•	One-sentence “So what for you.”
	7.	Track metrics
	•	Leads generated per MacroEvent.
	•	Enrichment success per MacroEvent type.
	•	(Eventually) reply / conversion per MacroEvent type.

⸻

TL;DR in Hoss Language
	•	ARCHANGEL v2 = the bounty hunter.
	•	SignalStorm = the scouts in the brush.
	•	MacroStorm / ForceCast = the satellite picture and intel brief from division HQ.

You’re not just telling SMBs “we found an email.”
You’re telling them:

“Here’s what’s about to happen around you,
here’s who’s going to feel it,
and here’s the move you should make —
and, by the way, we already drafted the first phone call / email for you.”

If you want, I can now:
	•	Flatten this whole thing (ARCHANGEL + SignalStorm + MacroStorm) into a single product/architecture doc in your tone that you can Slack to Melissa as “v1 strategy spec.”
