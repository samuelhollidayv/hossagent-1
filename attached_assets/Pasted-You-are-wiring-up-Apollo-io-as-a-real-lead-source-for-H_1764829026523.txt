You are wiring up Apollo.io as a real lead source for HossAgent.

Objective:
Let HossAgent ingest real, live leads from Apollo.io automatically — no manual portal steps required after initial configuration.

Do NOT require the user to go to Apollo and paste an API key manually. Do it the Hoss way:
- Let the user authorize via OAuth (if supported), or…
- Provide a one-click UI route to generate the key from within the HossAgent admin console
- Fallback to vault-based storage only if absolutely necessary

Here’s what I want you to do:

1. **Check Apollo.io’s API auth options:**
   - Does Apollo support OAuth2? If so, use it.
   - If not, create a secure UI flow that guides the user to create a key *inside* the HossAgent admin portal, with clear instructions and copy-paste auto-detection.

2. **Integrate Apollo into `lead_sources.py`:**
   - Add Apollo as a class or module implementing `LeadSource` interface
   - Inputs:
     - Niche filters (e.g. med spa, HVAC, roofing, immigration law)
     - Geo filters (e.g. South Florida, Miami, zip code radius)
     - Employee count filters (e.g. 1–200)
   - Outputs:
     - JSON array of real leads: name, company, email, title, industry, Apollo URL

3. **Add a toggle to switch from DummySeed → ApolloLive:**
   - In Settings or Admin view, add a dropdown: `Lead Source: [DummySeed] / [Apollo.io]`
   - When Apollo is selected and auth is configured, system will use Apollo on next Autopilot cycle

4. **Store the API key securely:**
   - If user chooses manual key, store it in encrypted secrets vault
   - Key name: `APOLLO_API_KEY`
   - Warn if invalid key returns 403 or quota limit

5. **Limit request rate to avoid API blocks:**
   - Max 100 calls/day per user during test phase
   - Log fetches in `apollo_fetch.log` with timestamp and query params

6. **Test plan:**
   - Run `fetch_leads(location="Miami", niche="HVAC", size="1-200")`
   - Log first 5 leads to console with full metadata
   - Confirm no dummy data is returned when Apollo is active

Confirm back once:
- Apollo is wired in as a real-time lead source
- Admin/Settings screen includes toggle between DummySeed and Apollo
- The system can rotate or fallback automatically if Apollo quota is hit

Let’s do this Hoss-style:
- No friction  
- No portals  
- No copy-paste keys from third-party dashboards  

Just plug in, switch on, and start hunting.

This system is live. We’re pulling **real leads** from **real signals** starting **right now.**
