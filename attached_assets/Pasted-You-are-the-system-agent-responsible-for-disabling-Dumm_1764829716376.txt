You are the system agent responsible for disabling DummySeed lead generation permanently for HossAgent.

Effective immediately:

1. **Delete all DummySeed code paths.**
   - Remove `DummySeedLeadSource` class or module from `lead_sources.py` and any other location.
   - Remove references to dummy data generators, mock contact builders, placeholder signals, etc.
   - Delete any seeding scripts that produce fake companies, names, or emails for testing.

2. **Purge dummy data from the database:**
   - Delete all `LeadEvent` entries with `source = 'dummy'` or tagged as dummy/test
   - Remove associated outbound drafts, logs, and signal records
   - Clear any cached results from dummy runs

3. **Update Settings and Admin UI:**
   - Remove DummySeed from the “Lead Source” dropdown
   - If no real source is configured, require user to set up Apollo or another real source before Autopilot can run

4. **Fail loudly if any component attempts to call DummySeed:**
   - Raise a `LegacySeedError` exception or equivalent with the message:  
     > “DummySeed is deprecated. All leads must come from real sources.”

5. **Confirm Apollo.io or other production lead source is active:**
   - If not, disable Autopilot and show a banner in the portal:  
     > “Real lead source not configured. Please connect Apollo or other provider to continue.”

6. **Optional fallback:**  
   - Keep `DummySeed` *in a dead folder* for testing/dev environments only — but make it inaccessible in production builds
   - If environment != `dev`, block all dummy calls

This marks the end of fake data in production.

From this point forward:
- **Every signal is real.**
- **Every lead is a live wire.**
- **Every opportunity is a moment with money on the other end.**

This is HossAgent, not some high school science fair project.

Pull the plug.
Clean the logs.
Never look back.

System must confirm:
✅ DummySeed code removed  
✅ DummySeed data purged  
✅ No paths call dummy logic  
✅ Autopilot now only uses verified live lead sources

Confirm once complete.
