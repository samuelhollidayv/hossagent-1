You are building the next iteration of HossAgent, an autonomous AI business engine. This is NOT a toy. It is a full-stack, minimal-but-powerful prototype of a future autonomous company. The UI must reflect that vision.

We will create:
	1.	A FastAPI backend
	2.	A SQLite data layer
	3.	Four autonomous agents (BizDev, Onboarding, Ops, Billing)
	4.	A sleek, cinematic, black-and-white landing + control room UI
	5.	A clean, plain-spoken narrative describing the grand vision without hype
	6.	Absolutely NO emojis, NO purple gradients, NO “cute” UI elements

Everything should feel:
	•	sharp
	•	minimal
	•	modern
	•	premium
	•	black-label tech
	•	with subtle noir photographic accents (use royalty-free B&W placeholder images or geometry if needed)

Think Black Mirror meets Hermès meets Palantir Foundry but for autonomous AI workers.

🔻 PART 1 — BACKEND (same architecture, cleaner execution)

Stack:
	•	Python
	•	FastAPI
	•	SQLite (SQLModel preferred)
	•	Uvicorn server
	•	agents.py for logic

Tables:

Lead
id, name, email, company, niche, status (new/contacted/responded/qualified/dead), last_contacted_at

Customer
id, company, contact_email, plan, status (active/trial/paused), notes

Task
id, customer_id, description, status (pending/running/done/failed), reward_cents, cost_cents, profit_cents, result_summary, created_at, completed_at

Invoice
id, customer_id, amount_cents, status (draft/sent/paid), created_at, paid_at, notes

⸻

🔻 PART 2 — AGENTS

Create agents.py with four stubs:

BizDev Agent

Temporarily fakes outbound by generating 1–2 new leads with realistic corporate names (no emojis, no jokes).

Onboarding Agent

Converts qualified leads into customers + creates a task template.

Ops Agent

Finds next pending task → marks running → simulates an OpenAI call → returns summary → sets cost_cents → calculates profit → marks done.
Comment clearly where REAL OpenAI logic will plug in later.

Billing Agent

Aggregates completed tasks → generates invoice drafts.

Each agent logs activity in plain, dry operational language.

⸻

🔻 PART 3 — API ENDPOINTS

Implement:
	•	GET /api/leads
	•	GET /api/customers
	•	GET /api/tasks
	•	GET /api/invoices
	•	POST /api/run/bizdev
	•	POST /api/run/onboarding
	•	POST /api/run/ops
	•	POST /api/run/billing
	•	Future hook: POST /api/tasks/{id}/complete

Serve the landing page + control room from /.

⸻

🔻 PART 4 — THE NEW UI

Replace the playful, purple, emoji UI with a cinematic black-and-white SaaS interface.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
	•	Full-width hero with a stark, high-contrast serif headline
	•	Deep blacks (#0A0A0A), gunmetal grey, white text
	•	Accent color very subtle — if used at all
	•	Grid layouts, lots of negative space
	•	Smooth fade-in transitions
	•	Noir / geometric imagery used as section dividers
	•	Typography = mix of Inter + a refined serif like Playfair or Spectral

COPY TONE:

Direct. Mature. Founder-to-investor.
Plain English.
Outlaw clarity.
No buzzwords.

Landing Hero:

Headline:
Autonomous AI workers.
Designed to earn.

Subheadline:
HossAgent turns AI into a labor engine: finding work, doing work, and proving its profit in real time.

CTA:
	•	Primary: “See the System” → scroll to Demo
	•	Secondary: “Talk to the Founder” → mailto: (add placeholder)

Use a minimal B&W abstract photo or pattern behind the hero content.

🔻 PART 5 — SECTION OUTLINES

1. “What This Is”

A plainspoken explanation:

“It’s a prototype of an autonomous business.
Four agents — BizDev, Onboarding, Ops, Billing — sharing one data model.
The system can discover leads, convert them, execute tasks, and generate invoices automatically.”

Include a monochrome horizontal image divider.

⸻

2. “Why This Matters”

Three clean cards:
	•	The cost of manual knowledge work is rising.
	•	AI tools are disconnected from business fundamentals.
	•	Nobody tracks ROI at the task level.

Short, sharp descriptions.

3. “The Architecture”

A horizontal step diagram:
Lead → Customer → Task → Invoice
Below it: “A minimal closed-loop business engine.”

4. “Live Demo: The Worker”
